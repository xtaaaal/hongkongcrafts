Bookmark and  Favorite plugin for WordPress. Create List(or non list) based bookmark like youtube, facebook with lots of features. Close integration with Classic editor using shortcode, Classic Widgets, Gutenberg Blocks, Elementor Widgets and WPBakery Widgets.

== Description ==

This plugin is inspired from youtube's bookmark or favorite feature. User can create their own bookmark category public or private and save articles inside different folders/list/category. Later we extended the plugin so that category can be global created by admin or single click bookmark without any category as pro features. There are lots of practical use for this simple but useful(we like to call it 'powerful') plugin. This plugin can help you create a bookmark site or user generated list site.
